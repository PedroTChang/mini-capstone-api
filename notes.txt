Exercise: Decomposition
Write out all the steps necessary for your mini-capstone backend to allow users to purchase products. (aim for roughly 5 to 10 steps)
For now, a user can submit an order for any quantity of a single product (we are not implementing a “shopping cart” where an order contains multiple products).
Do not write any code for this exercise; just focus on decomposing the different steps necessary to complete the feature.

1. I would first create a method that would allow the user to purchase a product
2. Then associate that product back to the product lists
3. When purchasing, I have to create an action
4. The action would need to do a couple of things:
  - change the product quantity
  - restrict the number of products
